/**
 * Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
 * An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
 * You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: grid = [
 *   ["1","1","1","1","0"],
 *   ["1","1","0","1","0"],
 *   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 *   ["0","0","0","0","0"]
 * ]
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: grid = [
 *   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 *   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 *   ["0","0","1","0","0"],
 *   ["0","0","0","1","1"]
 * ]
 * Output: 3

     * Approach:
     * Iterate through the grid. When a cell with value '1' (land) is encountered, increment the count of islands
     * and perform a DFS to visit all connected land cells. Mark visited cells by changing their value to '0'
     * to avoid re-processing. Continue until the entire grid is traversed.
     *
     * Time complexity: O(n * m)
     * - The grid is traversed once, and each cell is visited only once.
     *
     * Space complexity: O(n * m) in the worst case due to the recursion stack in DFS for a completely filled grid.

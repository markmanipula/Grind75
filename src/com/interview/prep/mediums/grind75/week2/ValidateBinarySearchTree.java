/**
 * Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
 *
 * A valid BST is defined as follows:
 *     The left
 *     subtree
 *     of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
 *     The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 *     Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: root = [2,1,3]
 * Output: true
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

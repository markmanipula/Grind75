/**
 * Given an array of words `wordsDict` and two different words `word1` and `word2`,
 * return the shortest distance between these two words in the array.
 *
 * Input:
 * - wordsDict: An array of strings representing a dictionary of words.
 * - word1, word2: Two distinct words present in the dictionary.
 *
 * Output:
 * - An integer representing the shortest distance (in terms of indices) between `word1` and `word2`.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: wordsDict = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]
 *        word1 = "coding", word2 = "practice"
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: wordsDict = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]
 *        word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
 * Output: 1

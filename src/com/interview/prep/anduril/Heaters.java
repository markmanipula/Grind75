/**
 * Winter is coming! During the contest, your first job is to design a standard heater with a fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.
 * Every house can be warmed, as long as the house is within the heater's warm radius range.
 * Given the positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, return the minimum radius standard of heaters so that those heaters could cover all houses.
 * Notice that all the heaters follow your radius standard, and the warm radius will the same.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: houses = [1,2,3], heaters = [2]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: houses = [1,2,3,4], heaters = [1,4]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The two heaters were placed at positions 1 and 4. We need to use a radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: houses = [1,5], heaters = [2]
 * Output: 3
